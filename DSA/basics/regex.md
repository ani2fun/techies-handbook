# Introduction to Regular Expressions

### Summary
- Regular expressions are special sequences of characters that describe a pattern of text that is to be matched
- We can use literals to match the exact characters that we desire
- Alternation, using the pipe symbol `|`, allows us to match the text preceding or following the `|`
- Character sets, denoted by a pair of brackets `[]`, let us match one character from a series of characters
Wildcards, represented by the period or dot `.`, will match any single character (letter, number, symbol or whitespace)
- Ranges allow us to specify a range of characters in which we can make a match
Shorthand character classes like `\w`, `\d` and `\s` represent the ranges representing word characters, digit characters, and whitespace characters, respectively
- Groupings, denoted with parentheses (), group parts of a regular expression together, and allows us to limit alternation to part of a regex
- Fixed quantifiers, represented with curly braces {}, let us indicate the exact quantity or a range of quantity of a character we wish to match
- Optional quantifiers, indicated by the question mark ?, allow us to indicate a character in a regex is optional, or can appear either 0 times or 1 time
- The Kleene star, denoted with the asterisk *, is a quantifier that matches the preceding character 0 or more times
- The Kleene plus, denoted by the plus +, matches the preceding character 1 or more times
- The anchor symbols hat ^ and dollar sign $ are used to match text at the start and end of a string, respectively


#### Character Sets in Regular Expressions
Regular expression character sets denoted by a pair of brackets [] will match any of the characters included within the brackets. For example, the regular expression con[sc]en[sc]us will match any of the spellings consensus, concensus, consencus, and concencus.

#### Optional Quantifiers in Regular Expressions
In Regular expressions, optional quantifiers are denoted by a question mark ?. It indicates that a character can appear either 0 or 1 time. For example, the regular expression humou?r will match the text humour as well as the text humor.

#### Literals in Regular Expressions
In Regular expression, the literals are the simplest characters that will match the exact text of the literals. For example, the regex monkey will completely match the text monkey but will also match monkey in text The monkeys like to eat bananas.

#### Fixed Quantifiers in Regular Expressions
In Regular expressions, fixed quantifiers are denoted by curly braces {}. It contains either the exact quantity or the quantity range of characters to be matched. For example, the regular expression roa{3}r will match the text roaaar, while the regular expression roa{3,6}r will match roaaar, roaaaar, roaaaaar, or roaaaaaar.

#### Alternation in Regular Expressions
Alternation indicated by the pipe symbol |, allows for the matching of either of two subexpressions. For example, the regex baboons|gorillas will match the text baboons as well as the text gorillas.

#### Anchors in Regular Expressions
Anchors (hat ^ and dollar sign $) are used in regular expressions to match text at the start and end of a string, respectively. For example, the regex ^Monkeys: my mortal enemy$ will completely match the text Monkeys: my mortal enemy but not match Spider Monkeys: my mortal enemy or Monkeys: my mortal enemy in the wild. The ^ ensures that the matched text begins with Monkeys, and the $ ensures the matched text ends with enemy.

#### Regular Expressions
Regular expressions are sequence of characters defining a pattern of text that needs to be found. They can be used for parsing the text files for specific pattern, verifying test results, and finding keywords in emails or webpages.

#### Wildcards in Regular expressions
In Regular expression, wildcards are denoted with the period . and it can match any single character (letter, number, symbol or whitespace) in a piece of text. For example, the regular expression ......... will match the text orangutan, marsupial, or any other 9-character text.

#### Regular Expression Ranges
Regular expression ranges are used to specify a range of characters that can be matched. Common regular expression ranges include: [A-Z]. : match any uppercase letter [a-z]. : match any lowercase letter [0-9]. : match any digit [A-Za-z] : match any uppercase or lowercase letter.

#### Shorthand Character Classes in Regular Expressions
Shorthand character classes simplify writing regular expressions. For example, \w represents the regex range [A-Za-z0-9_], \d represents [0-9], \W represents [^A-Za-z0-9_] matching any character not included by \w, \D represents [^0-9] matching any character not included by \d.

#### Kleene Star & Kleene Plus in Regular Expressions
In Regular expressions, the Kleene star(*) indicates that the preceding character can occur 0 or more times. For example, meo*w will match mew, meow, meooow, and meoooooooooooow. The Kleene plus(+) indicates that the preceding character can occur 1 or more times. For example, meo+w will match meow, meooow, and meoooooooooooow, but not match mew.

#### Grouping in Regular Expressions
In Regular expressions, grouping is accomplished by open ( and close parenthesis ). Thus the regular expression I love (baboons|gorillas) will match the text I love baboons as well as I love gorillas, as the grouping limits the reach of the | to the text within the parentheses.
